      Don''t worry, you are exactly where you need to be. This room was created to
      test your wits and your ability to survive.

      The first step is simple:
      observe every detail of the room. Don''t trust appearances: clues can be hidden
      in the most unexpected places. You will have to use logic, patience and courage
      to find the way out.'

      is not on your side.

      You are not the first to travel this path, others
      before you have tried... however, if you are lucky, you could be the last.

      Do
      not rush to look for a loophole, rather focus on what is around you. Even if
      everything seems unknown to you now, soon everything will fall into place...

      Good
      luck, and may your intuition guide you.'
